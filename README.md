# DIGIT POSITION IDENTIFIER IN NUMBER SERIES-by-Rishabh
This project is part of a Python programming assignment. It creates a sequential number string up to a user-defined limit and extracts the digit at any given position. It helps in understanding string slicing, indexing, and mathematical logic in programming.



This Python program creates a continuous number series (like 123456789101112…) and helps the user find the digit at any specific position in the series.

## How it works
1. You enter a number up to which the series should be generated.
2. The program prints the series up to the number of digits you want.
3. You enter a digit position.
4. The program shows the digit present at that position.

## Example
Enter the number: 20  
Enter the digit till you want the series to be printed: 30  
The required seq is: 123456789101112131415161718192  
Enter the digit position: 30  
Number at digit 30 is: 2
