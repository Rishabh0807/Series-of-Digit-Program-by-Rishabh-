# 📜 Project Statement and Scope

## 1. Project Identification
**Project Name:**Series of Digit Program by Rishabh**
**Repository Link:** [https://github.com/Rishabh0807/Series-of-Digit-Program-by-Rishabh-]
**Primary Goal:** To To create a python program that generates a continious number series and allows the user to find the digit at any specific position easily.

## 2. Problem Addressed
The project addresses the difficulty of manually finding which digit appears at a specific position in a long,continious number series.Counting Digits one by one in sequences like 1234567891011112...is slow and error prone so the program automates this process by generating the sequence and instantly returning the correct digit.

## 3. Scope Definition

### In Scope (What the project explicitly includes)
* ** Generating a continious series starting from 1
* ** Allowing the user to choose how many digits of the series should be printed.
* ** Taking a digit position as input from the user.
* ** Displaying a digit position as input from the user
* ** Using basic Python concepts like loops,strings,slicing and indexing
* ** Providing clear input and output formatting

### Out of Scope (What the project will NOT include in this version)
* Generating custom series(odd number,Fibonacci,etc)
* Handling complex errors or invalid inputs extensively
* Adding a Graphical user Interface
* Storing Data in flies or databases
* 

## 4. Target Users
The system is designed for **College Students and working professionals** who require a streamlined solution for runnimg there programs smoothly

## 5. Next Steps / Future Enhancements
We plan to implement the following features in subsequent releases:
1.  Adding advanced filtering and search capabilities.
2.  Developing a notification system for critical events.
3.  Optimizing the database structure for high-volume transactions.
