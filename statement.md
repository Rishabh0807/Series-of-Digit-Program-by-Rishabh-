# 📜 Project Statement and Scope

## 1. Project Identification
**Project Name:** Series of Digit Program by Rishabh
**Repository Link:** [https://github.com/Rishabh0807/Series-of-Digit-Program-by-Rishabh-]
**Primary Goal:** To To create a python program that generates a continious number series and allows the user to find the digit at any specific position easily.

## 2. Problem Addressed
The project addresses the difficulty of manually finding which digit appears at a specific position in a long,continious number series.Counting Digits one by one in sequences like 1234567891011112...is slow and error prone so the program automates this process by generating the sequence and instantly returning the correct digit.

## 3. Scope Definition

### In Scope (What the project explicitly includes)
* **Core Feature 1:** [E.g., Secure User Authentication (Login/Logout/Registration)].
* **Core Feature 2:** [E.g., CRUD operations for the main data entity (e.g., creating and managing 'Tasks')].
* **Core Feature 3:** [E.g., Generating basic summary reports or visualizations].
* **Technology Stack:** [List main technologies, e.g., Python (Flask), React, PostgreSQL].

### Out of Scope (What the project will NOT include in this version)
* Mobile application development or dedicated mobile UI.
* Integration with external third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, advanced mapping services).
* Real-time data synchronization via WebSockets.

## 4. Target Users
The system is designed for **[Primary User Role, e.g., Small Business Owners]** and **[Secondary User Role, e.g., Team Managers]** who require a streamlined solution for [Target Activity].

## 5. Next Steps / Future Enhancements
We plan to implement the following features in subsequent releases:
1.  Adding advanced filtering and search capabilities.
2.  Developing a notification system for critical events.
3.  Optimizing the database structure for high-volume transactions.
